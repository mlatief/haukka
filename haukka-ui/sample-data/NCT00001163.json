Individuals and families are studied long-term, using a cohort\n      approach.\n\n      The study design and clinical evaluation vary by the specific type of familial neoplasm\n      being studied.\n\n      The overall approach to eligible study participants includes defining affection status,\n      characterization of disease, localization of genetic loci, identification of genes,\n      evaluation of phenotype\/genotype correlations, estimation of risk of the disease associated\n      with carrier status and identification of other risk factors that modify penetrance\n      (genetic, environmental, host factors).\n    ",

For familial neoplasms, two or more\n        living affected cases among family members are required. The types of familial tumors that\n        we are currently actively accruing include:\n\n        Familial Cancers:  bladder, brain, chordoma, lung, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome\n        (NBCC)\n\n        Familial Benign Neoplasms:  meningiomas, neurofibromatosis 2 (bilateral acoustic\n        neurofibromatosis)\n\n        The types of familial tumors under active accrual and study are predominantly\n        investigator-and hypothesis-driven.  This approach permits GEB investigators to remain\n        alert to the opportunities afforded by clusters of rare tumors in families and\n        individuals, and to be more responsive to the dynamic research priorities in cancer\n        genetics.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        Referred individuals and families for whom reported diagnoses cannot be verified.\n\n        Inability to provide informed consent.\n\n        Eligible for familial melanoma, lymphoproliferative, breast-ovarian cancer, or testicular\n        cancer protocols.\n      ",

			"textblock" : "\n      This is a clinical, epidemiologic, genetic, and laboratory study of individuals and families\n      at high risk of cancer and selected tumors to investigate the genetic susceptibility and\n      environmental exposures which may alter cancer risk.  Families with multiple members who\n      have an unusual pattern or number of cancers or tumors are evaluated clinically.  This\n      evaluation is specific for the type of cancer or tumor predominant in the family in order to\n      determine the affection status of each individual for genetic epidemiologic studies.\n      Genetic and environmental risk factor information specific for the tumor type is obtained.\n\n      Individuals with, or at high risk of, cancer because of their personal, familial, or\n      environmental histories are identified by healthcare worker referral or by personal inquiry.\n       Relevant etiologic risk factor information is documented through review of pathology\n      specimens and medical, vital, and genealogical records.  Selected individuals and family\n      members are asked to complete questionnaires and to undergo clinical evaluations specific\n      for the tumor of interest. They are also asked to donate biologic specimens to be used in\n      the search for cancer etiology and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. No therapy beyond\n      counseling and education for cancer prevention, risk reduction, and early detection will be\n      given.\n\n      Genetic testing for tumor susceptibility gene(s) mutations and risk notification will be\n      offered to study participants for whom a specific mutation predictive of disease has been\n      identified in his\/her family.  This testing will only be offered when reasonable individual\n      cancer risk estimates can be delivered, and only to those participants who choose to know\n      their individual genetic status after appropriate education and counseling.  The testing\n      will be conducted exclusively in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-licensed\n      laboratories.  Genetic testing and risk notification are entirely optional and do not affect\n      participation in other aspects of the protocol.  A separate consent procedure and consent\n      form will be used for genetic testing and risk notification related to these specific genes.\n\n      Once enrolled, study participants are monitored prospectively for the development of\n      outcomes of interest, typically by means of periodic mail or telephone contact.  In selected\n      instances, subjects may return to the Clinical Center periodically for study-specific\n      follow-up examinations.  Although we do not offer specific anti-cancer therapy as part of\n      this protocol, we provide assistance to insure that study participants who require treatment\n      for tumor-related problems that develop during the course of the study are referred to\n      appropriate healthcare providers.  We remain available to study participants and their\n      healthcare providers for advice and consultation related to the management of familial\n      cancer\/tumor predisposition.\n    ",
