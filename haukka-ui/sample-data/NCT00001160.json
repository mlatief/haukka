Study subjects\n      will include adults and children with thyroid nodules or cancer requiring diagnostic fine\n      needle aspiration biopsy, surgery, radioiodine scanning or therapy for persistent or\n      recurrent disease.\n\n      In this natural history protocol, the use of methods for follow-up of patients using\n      radiopharmaceutical tracers such as (131)I, (123)I, (201)T1 chloride, (99)mTc-Sestamibi,\n      (111)Inpentetreotide and 18-FDG PET will be evaluated.  All radionuclides will be\n      administered according to standard clinical practice indications and published guidelines.\n      The limitations and significance of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement for diagnosing\n      tumor recurrence will be assessed.  The study will permit a continued evaluation of the\n      risk\/benefit ratio of already established methods of administering (131)I therapy including\n      the impact of pre-treatment dosimetric calculations and administration of lithium (a well\n      established, yet not widely used, adjuvant to (131)I treatment), especially in selected\n      cases of thyroid cancer in which high-dose (greater than 150mCi) (131)I therapy is\n      clinically indicated.\n\n      Under this protocol, samples of benign nodules and cancer tissue specimens for research\n      studies will be collected to assess new immunohistochemical markers, and other techniques to\n      characterize tumors for correlation with response to therapy and prognosis. Blood and urine\n      specimens will be collected for future clinical and research studies in both the hypothyroid\n      and euthyroid state. Coded clinical data will be entered in the National Thyroid Cancer\n      Registry in selected patients.\n    ",
