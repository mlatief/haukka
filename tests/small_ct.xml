  <official_title>A Phase II, Open-label, Study in Subjects With BRAF V600E-Mutated Rare Cancers With Several Histologies to Investigate the Clinical Efficacy and Safety of the Combination Therapy of Dabrafenib and Trametinib</official_title>
  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of oral Dabrafenib in
      combination with oral Trametinib in subjects with rare cancers including anaplastic thyroid
      cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, non-seminomatous germ cell
      tumor/non-geminomatous germ cell tumor, hairy cell leukemia, World Health Organization (WHO)
      Grade 1 or 2 glioma, WHO Grade 3 or 4 (high-grade) glioma, multiple myeloma, and
      adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with BRAF V600E positive-mutations. This study is
      designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with
      oral Trametinib in subjects with rare BRAF V600E mutated cancers. Subjects will need to have
      a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the BRAF V600E mutation status.
      Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard
      treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will undergo screening
      assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease
      assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment
      in the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed, written informed consent.

          -  Sex: male or female.

          -  Age: &gt;=18 years of age at the time of providing informed consent.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status: 0, 1 or 2.

          -  BRAF V600E mutation-positive tumor: Local testing - Local BRAF mutation test results
             obtained by a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) approved local
             laboratory may be used to permit enrollment of subjects with positive results. Local
             BRAF mutation test results will be subject to central verification; Central testing -
             Local BRAF mutation test results will be confirmed by central testing in a CLIA
             approved, designated central reference laboratory by the THxID BRAF assay or an
             alternate GSK designated assay. NOTE: For central testing, Formalin-fixed
             paraffin-embedded (FFPE) core bone marrow (BM) biopsies are not acceptable from
             subjects in the Multiple myeloma (MM) cohort.

          -  Able to swallow and retain orally administered medication. NOTE: Subject should not
             have any clinically significant gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities that may alter
             absorption such as malabsorption syndrome or major resection of the stomach or
             bowels. For example, subjects should have no more than 50% of the large intestine
             removed and no sign of malabsorption (i.e., diarrhea).NOTE: If clarification is
             needed as to whether a condition will significantly affect the absorption of study
             treatments, contact the GSK Medical Monitor.

          -  Female Subjects of Childbearing Potential:  Subjects must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to the first dose of study treatment and agrees to
             use effective contraception, throughout the treatment period and for 4 months after
             the last dose of study treatment.

          -  French subjects: In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study
             only if either affiliated to or a beneficiary of a social security category.
