within the same liver segment as long as the dose constraints to normal tissue can be met.
This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of oral Dabrafenib in
combination with oral Trametinib in subjects with rare cancers including anaplastic thyroid
cancer, biliary tract cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, non-seminomatous germ cell
tumor/non-geminomatous germ cell tumor, hairy cell leukemia, World Health Organization (WHO)
Grade 1 or 2 glioma, WHO Grade 3 or 4 (high-grade) glioma, multiple myeloma, and
adenocarcinoma of the small intestine, with [BRAF V600E] positive-mutations. This study is
designed to determine the overall response rate (ORR) of oral Dabrafenib in combination with
oral Trametinib in subjects with rare [BRAF V600E] mutated cancers. Subjects will need to have
a fresh or frozen tumor tissue sample provided to confirm the [BRAF V600E] mutation status.
Only subjects with histologically confirmed advanced disease and no available standard
treatment options will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will undergo screening
assessments within 14 days (up to 35 days for ophthalmology exam, echocardiogram or disease
assessments) prior to the start of treatment to determine their eligibility for enrollment
in the study.
