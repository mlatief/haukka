1/2
Study
of
X-396
an
Oral
[ALK]
Inhibitor
in
Patients
With
[ALK-positive]
Non-Small
Cell
Lung
Cancer.
This
is
the
first
human
study
to
use
X-396
a
drug
being
developed
for
treatment
of
advanced
cancers.
The
initial
purpose
of
the
study
is
to
determine
the
largest
amount
of
X-396
that
can
be
safely
given
to
humans
(the
maximum
tolerated
dose.
Once
the
recommended
Phase
2
dose
has
been
determined
an
expansion
phase
will
assess
the
preliminary
anti-tumor
activity
of
X-396
in
[ALK-positive]
non-small
cell
lung
cancer.
The
study
will
also
provide
early
information
on
how
the
body
handles
the
drug
pharmacokinetics
and
on
the
efficacy
of
X-396.
This
is
the
first
study
of
X-396
in
humans
and
the
investigational
drug
will
be
given
as
a
once
or
twice
daily
oral
dose
in
28
day
cycles
until
there
is
disease
progression
or
unacceptable
safety
issues.
X-396
will
be
given
to
small
groups
of
patients
1
6
at
each
dose
level
and
the
patients
will
be
observed
to
see
if
there
are
any
adverse
safety
effects.
As
long
as
there
are
no
unacceptable
safety
issues
after
28
days
the
dose
of
X-396
will
be
increased
for
the
next
group
of
patients.
This
process
will
continue
until
the
maximum
tolerated
dose
(MTD)
of
X-396
is
reached.
Once
the
MTD
is
reached
up
to
60
additional
patients
will
also
be
given
X-396
to
further
determine
the
activity
of
X-396
in
patients
with
[ALK-positive]
non-small
cell
lung
cancer.
These
additional
patients
will
be
enrolled

PCRTALK.
The
anaplastic 
lymphoma
kinase
gene
[ALK]
is
mutated
approximately
5%
of
non-small
cell 
lung
cancers.
Testing
for
this
gene
is
important
because
there
are
drugs
known
as
[ALK]
inhibitors
that
have
been
shown
to
significantly
delay
the
progression
of
[ALK-mutated]
lung
cancers.
There
are
a
number
of
ways
to
test
for
the
presence
of
the
[ALK]
gene
in
lung cancer
biopsy
tissue.
One
method
involves
making
slides
and
staining
them
to
detect
the
[ALK]
protein.
This
is
called
immunohistochemistry.
Another
method
called
fluorescence
in
situ
hybridization
FISH
is
used
to
detect
rearrangements
of
the
[ALK]
gene
associated
with
lung
cancer.
Although
both
these
tests
are
widely
used
to
test
for
[ALK]
gene
abnormalities
the
techniques
may
not
always
find
the
[ALK]
gene
mutation
because
they
are
not
sensitive
enough
or
not
enough
cancer
cells
are
present
in
the
lung
biopsy.
This
study
is
being
performed
to
determine
if
a
technique
called
quantitation
polymerase
chain
reaction
qPCR
is
as
accurate
or
better
at
finding
the
[ALK]
gene
mutation
in

[BRAF V600E]
Mutations
In
Papillary
Thyroid
Carcinoma.
The
purpose
of
this
study
is
to
determine
whether
[BRAF V600E]
mutation
in
our
patients
with
papillary
thyroid
cancer
has
an
association
with
poor
prognosis.
Papillary
thyroid
carcinoma
[PTC]
is
the
most
common
type
of
thyroid
malignancy
and
[BRAF V600E]
mutation
is
the
most
common
genetic
alteration
identified
in
PTC
ranging
from
25
to
80%
with
the
average
rate
about
45%.
Various
studies
demonstrated
a
relationship
between
[BRAF V600E]
mutation
and
aggressive
characteristics
of
the
cancer,
including
the
worse
patient
prognosis.
But 
there
are
no
studies
from
Turkey
regarding
this
topic.
So
the
investigators
will
examine
[BRAF V600E]
mutation
in
our
patients
with
PTC
and
try
to
assess
the
role
of
this
mutation
in
prognosis
and
further
management
of
the
patients.

The

is
to

is
designed

of

Overall

at
the

The

Despite
a
very
promising
overall

rate
of
81%
these

will
also
likely
go
on
to
develop

as
a

Erdheim-Chester
Diseases
ECD
is
a
very
rare
non-Langerhans
cell
histiocytosis
of
unknown
origin
and
pathogenesis.
It
has
been
reported
mainly
in
adult
males
over
the
age
of
40
years
although
cases
have
been
reported
in
females
as
well.
Children
are
rarely
affected.
Mutation
of
the
[BRAF]
gene,
specifically
[BRAFV600E]
has
been
recently
identified
in
50%
of
Erdheim
Chester
lesions
in
a
French
cohort.
This
somatic
mutation
is
believed
to
be
the
driver
mutation
in
positive
cases.
The
clinical
characteristics
of
ECD
range
from
asymptomatic
to
multisystemic
involvement;
longitudinal
progression
and
natural
history
are
becoming
better
understood.
ECD
commonly
affects
the
bones
kidneys
retroperitoneal
space
skin
and
brain.
If
untreated
the
disease
progresses
rapidly
causing
fatal
outcomes
due
to
severe
lung
disease,
chronic
renal
failure
cardiomyopathy
and
other
complications.
The
diagnosis
of
ECD
relies
upon
imaging
studies
and
specific
pathologic
findings
in
biopsies
of
affected
organs
fibrosis
and
infiltration
of
tissues
with
foamy
histiocytes

and
plasma
cells.
Immunohistochemistry
reveals
cells
positive
for
CD68
and
CD163
and
negative
for
CD1a
with
20%

There
is
no
standard
treatment
for
ECD,
although
chemotherapy
radiation
stem
cell
transplantion,
alpha-interferon
anakinra
imatinib
and
sirolimus
have
been
proposed.
The
recent
discovery
of
the
[BRAFV600E]
mutation
in
several
ECD
patients
has
opened
a
new
area

FDA
approved
BRAF
inhibitor
for
the
treatment
of
patients
with
metastatic
or
unresectable
melanoma
with
the
[V600E]
mutation
binds
to
this
form
of
mutated
BRAF
causing
protein
inactivation.
The
use
of
vemurafenib
in
patients
with
ECD
has
been
reported
in
3
patients
who
experienced
remission
of
the
disease,
and
is
currently
being
studied
in
the
U.S.
and

as

Tumor/disease
resistance
to
vemurafenib
has
occurred
in
[melanoma]
and
other
cancers
although
it
has
not
been
reported
in
patients
with
ECD.
In
this
protocol
we
propose
to
clinically
evaluate
ECD
patients
with
the
[BRAFV600E]
mutation
and
administer
combination
therapy
with
dabrafenib
a
[BRAFV600E]
inhibitor
and
trametinib
an
inhibitor
of
[MEK]
downstream
of
[BRAF].
Screening
for
possible
contraindications
will
be
made
prior
to
the
administration
of
the
first
dose.
With
this
trial
we
will
determine
the
safety
tolerability
and
efficacy
of
dabrafenib
and
trametinib
in
patients
with
ECD
who
harbor
