    <description>Phase II arm 1a will randomize 60 patients that are naïve to prior BRAF inhibitor therapy to LGX818+LEE011 to evaluate the effect of adding LEE011 to a BRAFi in this population.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Phase II arm 1b will randomize 30 patients to LGX818. Single agent anti-tumor activity of LGX818 is comparable to other BRAFi that are either approved or in clinical trials. This single agent anti-tumor activity will be compared to that of the combination (LEE011 + LGX818) in the BRAFi naïve patient population.</description>

    <description>Phase II arm 2 will evaluate a single arm LEE011+LGX818 in 40 patients resistant to prior BRAF inhibitor therapy. Single agent LGX818 has shown limited activity in patients with melanoma who have failed prior BRAF inhibitor treatment; the contribution of LEE011 in this combination will be evaluated.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Diagnosis of locally advanced or metastatic melanoma along with written
             documentation of BRAF V600 mutation.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 - 2.

          -  Patients enrolled into Phase Ib must have evidence of evaluable and/or measurable
             disease as determined by RECIST v1.1.

          -  Patients enrolled into Phase II (BRAFi naïve and resistant) must have evidence of
             measurable disease as determined by RECIST v1.1.

          -  Archival tumor tissue must be obtained for patients enrolled in Phase Ib and Phase II
             arm 1a/b- BRAFi naïve patients. If an archival tumor tissue is not available, a fresh
             tumor sample is acceptable.

          -  For patients enrolled in the phase II arm 2, patients must agree to undergo a fresh
             tumor biopsy unless one was collected prior to study entry but at the time of disease
             relapse from the most recent BRAFi treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptomatic brain metastases.

          -  Symptomatic or untreated leptomeningeal disease.

          -  Patients with inadequate laboratory values during screening.

          -  In the phase II BRAFi naïve arms (1a/b), prior exposure to CDK4/6 inhibitor (e.g., PD
             0332991)

          -  Impaired cardiac function or clinically significant cardiac diseases.

          -  Impairment of gastro-intestinal (GI) function or GI disease that may significantly
             alter the absorption of LEE011 or LGX818.

          -  Patients with concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical conditions.

          -  Previous or concurrent malignancy.

          -  Major surgery &lt; 2 weeks before starting study treatment

          -  Known diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C.

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
