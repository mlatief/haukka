  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants in this study will be patients diagnosed with or suspected to have a thyroid
      nodule or thyroid cancer.

      The main purpose of this study is to further understand the methods for the diagnosis and
      treatment of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.  Many of the test performed are in the
      context of standard medical care that is offered to all patients with thyroid nodules or
      thyroid cancer.  Other tests are performed for research purposes.  In addition, blood and
      tissue samples will be taken for research and genetic studies.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate methods for preoperative diagnosis and therapy of
      thyroid cancer and to screen patients for participation in other protocols.  Study subjects
      will include adults and children with thyroid nodules or cancer requiring diagnostic fine
      needle aspiration biopsy, surgery, radioiodine scanning or therapy for persistent or
      recurrent disease.

      In this natural history protocol, the use of methods for follow-up of patients using
      radiopharmaceutical tracers such as (131)I, (123)I, (201)T1 chloride, (99)mTc-Sestamibi,
      (111)Inpentetreotide and 18-FDG PET will be evaluated.  All radionuclides will be
      administered according to standard clinical practice indications and published guidelines.
      The limitations and significance of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) measurement for diagnosing
      tumor recurrence will be assessed.  The study will permit a continued evaluation of the
      risk/benefit ratio of already established methods of administering (131)I therapy including
      the impact of pre-treatment dosimetric calculations and administration of lithium (a well
      established, yet not widely used, adjuvant to (131)I treatment), especially in selected
      cases of thyroid cancer in which high-dose (greater than 150mCi) (131)I therapy is
      clinically indicated.

      Under this protocol, samples of benign nodules and cancer tissue specimens for research
      studies will be collected to assess new immunohistochemical markers, and other techniques to
      characterize tumors for correlation with response to therapy and prognosis. Blood and urine
      specimens will be collected for future clinical and research studies in both the hypothyroid
      and euthyroid state. Coded clinical data will be entered in the National Thyroid Cancer
      Registry in selected patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Adults and children with known or suspected thyroid neoplasm will be considered for
        participation.  Enrollment will be capped accordingly:

          1. Patients with thyroid nodules requiring evaluation and possible biopsy (no more than
             30 per year);

          2. Patients with recent diagnosis of thyroid cancer requiring consultation and
             counseling about therapeutic options (no more than 10 per year);

          3. Patients with established thyroid cancer requiring specialized studies such as (131)I
             dosimetry (no more than 5 per year);

          4. Enrollment of high risk, non-iodine avid, inoperable thyroid cancer only for purposes
             of screening for eligibility for other specific thyroid cancer protocols.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Serious underlying medical conditions that restrict diagnostic testing or therapy
             such as renal failure, congestive cardiac failure or active coexisting non-thyroid
             carcinoma;

          2. Patients unable or unwilling to give informed consent
